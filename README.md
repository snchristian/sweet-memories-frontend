# :candy: Sweet Memories

This is a simple E-commerce frontend application. This project aims to showcase the skills I learned in Phase 3 of my Flatiron School course by building a project using the Sintra API backend and a React frontend for the interface

## :page_facing_up: Overview

In this project, using Sintra and Ruby for the backend and React and Material UI for the frontend, I created a retro candy storefront. This application allows customers to pick from several old-fashioned candies, place them in their cart, and checkout. After placing their order, customers can also delete any candy that they may no longer desire. 

## :sparkler: Features

 - Display variety of reto candies for purchase.
 - Add candy to cart and modify items in the cart
